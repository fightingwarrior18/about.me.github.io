Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I have designed a website about myself that describes me.
The first html page index is the home page of the website that is linked to the other three pages.The home page is a brief description about me.The page has a navigation bar made of list an a icon of my page.
The second page of the website is all about my carrier choices and my professional life.
The third page is about my interests and it uses a table grid model using bootstrap 4.
The last page of the website is my contact details and I have used a bootstrap component of alert in the page.
All of the pages are linked to a style.css file to give design to the pages.
